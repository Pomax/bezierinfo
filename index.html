        </div>

        <p>In order to draw things in 2D, we usually rely on lines, which typically get classified
        into two categories: straight lines, and curves. The first of these are as easy to draw as they
        are easy to make a computer draw. Give a computer the first and last point in the line, and
        BAM! straight line. No questions asked.</p>

        <p>Curves, however, are a much bigger problem. While we can draw curves with ridiculous ease
        freehand, computers are a bit handicapped in that they can't draw curves unless there is a
        mathematical function that describes how it should be drawn. In fact, they even need this for
        straight lines, but the function is ridiculously easy, so we tend to ignore that as far as
        computers are concerned, all lines are "functions", regardless of whether they're straight
        or lines. However, that does mean that we need to come up with fast-to-compute functions that
        lead to nice looking curves on a computer. There's a number of these, and in this article
        we'll focus on a particular function that has received quite a bit of attention, and is used
        in pretty much anything that can draw curves: "Bézier" curves</p>

        <p>They're named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_B%C3%A9zier">Pierre
        Bézier</a>, who is principally responsible for getting them known to the world as a curve
        well-suited for design work (working for Renault and publishing his investigations in 1962),
        although he was not the first, or only one, to "invent" these type of curves.
        One might be tempted to say that the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_de_Casteljau">Paul
        de Casteljau</a> was first, investigating the nature of these curves in 1959 while working at
        Citroën, coming up with a really elegant way of figuring out how to draw them. However, de
        Casteljau did not publish his work, making the question "who was first" hard to answer in
        any absolute sense. Or is it? Bézier curves are, at their core, "Bernstein polynomials", a family
        of mathematical functions investigated by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Natanovich_Bernstein">Sergei Natanovich Bernstein</a>,
        with publications on them at least as far back as 1912. Anyway, that's mostly trivia, what
        you are more likely to care about is that these curves are handy: you can linked up multiple
        Bézier curves so that the combination looks like a single curve. If you've ever drawn Photoshop
        "paths" or worked with vector drawing programs like Flash, Illustrator or Inkscape, those curves
        you've been drawing are Bézier curves.</p>

        <p>So, what if you need to program them yourself? What are the pitfalls? How do you draw them?
        What are the bounding boxes, how do you determine intersections, how can you extrude a curve,
        in short: how do you do everything that you might want when you do with these curves? That's
        what this page is for. Prepare to be mathed.</p>

        <div id="article-notes">
          <h2 style="font-style:italic;">All Bézier graphics are interactive.</h2>

          <p>This page uses <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> examples, rendering as
          interactive graphics on the page using <a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.js</a>,
          which means you don't need any plugins if you're on a modern browser. (If you
          are still using IE8 because you're on Windows XP, be aware Microsoft would rather you start
          using something like Firefox than keep using IE8, because IE8 does not support the internet
          anymore. It was already a little behind when it was first released, but today it literally
          doesn't support the internet, a bit like the difference between wordpad and Word. IE8 is
          no longer a web browser, it's a legacy application). It also uses math, in LaTeX form, which
          is typeset using the most excellent <a href="http://mathjax.org">MathJax</a> library.</p>

          <h2 style="font-style:italic;">Examples have a "view source" option.</h2>

          <p>Just seeing that the guy who wrote the article knows how to write the code needed to
          demonstrate Bézier curve things is basically useless, I think you'll agree. You don't benefit
          from me going: <em>"Look at me, I know how to program, ooooh~"</em>. So to make things <em>useful</em>,
          all graphics on this page have "view source" links. Click them, copy the source code, fire
          up the <a href="http://processing.org/download/">Processing PDE</a>, paste the code, and
          hit "play". You should see the exact same thing now running on your own computer as you're
          seeing in the browser. This is working code, and you can trace everything I do. Regardless
          of whether you <em>want</em> to, I consider it important that you can. And the kicker is
          this code is in the public domain. I waive all rights to it. Do with it what you want, to
          me this is trivial code and it would be ridiculous to claim it as anything other than "I
          just wrote this to demonstrate how things work".</p>

          <h2 style="font-style:italic;">Questions, comments:</h2>

          If you have suggestions for new sections, hit up the <a href="https://github.com/pomax/bezierinfo/issues">github
          issue tracker</a> (also reachable from the repo linked to in the upper right). If you have
          questions about the material, there's currently no comment section while I'm doing the rewrite,
          but you can use the issue tracker for that as well. Once the rewrite is done, I'll add a general
          comment section back in, and maybe a more topical "select this section of text and hit the
          'question' button to ask a question about it" system. We'll see.
